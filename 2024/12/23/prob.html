<p><span>When we think about probability, there are three </span>
<span>main philosophical approaches: frequentist, Bayesian, and propensity. Each offers </span>
<span>a different lens for understanding uncertainty and probability.</span></p>
<section id="The-Scenario">

    <h2>
    <a href="#The-Scenario"><span>The Scenario</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>Imagine we</span>&rsquo;<span>re dealing with a new diagnostic test for a rare genetic condition that affects 1 in 1000 people. The test has the following characteristics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>If someone has the condition, the test will be positive 99% of the time (sensitivity)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>If someone doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t have the condition, the test will be negative 95% of the time (specificity)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Now, let</span>&rsquo;<span>s say Sarah gets tested and receives a positive result. What</span>&rsquo;<span>s the probability that she </span>
<span>actually has the condition? Each probability paradigm approaches this question differently.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="The-Frequentist-Approach">

    <h2>
    <a href="#The-Frequentist-Approach"><span>The Frequentist Approach</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>The frequentist views probability as the long-run frequency of events in repeated trials. They might say:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span>If we were to run this test on a very large number of people, and look only at </span>
<span>the positive test results, what proportion of those people would actually have the condition?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>The frequentist would focus on the sampling distribution and confidence intervals. They might </span>
<span>resist making a direct probability statement about Sarah</span>&rsquo;<span>s individual case, arguing that she </span>
<span>either has the condition or doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t – there</span>&rsquo;<span>s no probability about it. Instead, they </span>
<span>would frame their analysis in terms of error rates and long-term frequencies.</span></p>
<p><span>In this case, they would calculate the false positive and true positive rates across a hypothetical population:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>In 1000 people, 1 person would have the condition</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>That 1 person would test positive 99% of the time = 0.99 true positives</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>The 999 people without the condition would test positive 5% of the time = 49.95 false positives</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Total positive tests = 50.94</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Proportion of positive tests that are true positives ≈ 1.94%</span>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="The-Bayesian-Approach">

    <h2>
    <a href="#The-Bayesian-Approach"><span>The Bayesian Approach</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>The Bayesian sees probability as a degree of belief that gets updated with </span>
<span>new evidence. They would start with a prior probability (the base </span>
<span>rate of 1/1000) and update it with the new </span>
<span>evidence (the positive test result) using Bayes</span>&rsquo;<span> Theorem.</span></p>
<p><span>The Bayesian would say: </span>&ldquo;<span>Before the test, we believed Sarah had a 0.1% chance </span>
<span>of having the condition. The positive test result gives us new information </span>
<span>to update this belief.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Using Bayes</span>&rsquo;<span> Theorem:</span>
<span>P(Condition|Positive) = P(Positive|Condition) × P(Condition) / P(Positive)</span>
<span>= 0.99 × 0.001 / (0.99 × 0.001 + 0.05 × 0.999)</span>
<span>≈ 0.0194 or about 1.94%</span></p>
<p><span>The Bayesian is comfortable making a direct probability statement about Sarah</span>
&lsquo;<span>s specific case, saying there</span>&rsquo;<span>s a 1.94% chance she has the condition.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="The-Propensity-Approach">

    <h2>
    <a href="#The-Propensity-Approach"><span>The Propensity Approach</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>The propensity theorist views probability as an objective </span>
<span>physical property – a tendency or disposition of a </span>
<span>system to produce certain outcomes. They might say:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span>The test result reflects the physical properties of Sarah</span>&rsquo;<span>s </span>
<span>genes and the testing mechanism. The probability emerges from </span>
<span>the actual physical setup of the situation.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>They would focus on the causal mechanisms involved: the biological </span>
<span>factors that cause the condition, the chemical reactions in the test, and how </span>
<span>these physical properties interact to produce results. They might analyze the </span>
<span>molecular basis of the test</span>&rsquo;<span>s accuracy and how it interacts with the genetic markers it</span>&rsquo;<span>s designed to detect.</span></p>
<p><span>These different approaches can lead to different practical recommendations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>A frequentist might emphasize the need for additional testing, pointing out that in a large population, most positive results are false positives.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>A Bayesian might focus on gathering more prior information about Sarah (family history, symptoms, etc.) to refine the probability estimate.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>A propensity theorist might advocate for understanding the biological mechanism better, perhaps recommending a different type of test that targets the condition</span>&rsquo;<span>s physical manifestations more directly.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
