<p><span>In the pursuit of scaling neural networks to unprecedented parameter counts while </span>
<span>maintaining computational tractability, the paradigm of conditional computation </span>
<span>has emerged as a cornerstone of modern deep learning architectures. A prominent and </span>
<span>highly successful incarnation of this principle is the Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer. At its core, an MoE model eschews </span>
<span>the monolithic, dense activation of traditional networks, wherein every parameter is engaged </span>
<span>for every input. Instead, it employs a collection of specialized </span>
<span>subnetworks, termed </span>&ldquo;<span>experts,</span>&rdquo;<span> and dynamically selects a sparse combination of these </span>
<span>experts to process each input token. This approach allows for a dramatic increase in </span>
<span>model capacity without a commensurate rise in computational cost (FLOPs), as only </span>
<span>a fraction of the network</span>&rsquo;<span>s parameters are utilized for any given forward pass.</span></p>
<p><span>The architecture is orchestrated by two primary components: a set of N expert </span>
<span>networks, E</span><em><span>1, E</span></em><span>2, </span>&hellip;<span>, E_N, and a trainable gating network, G. The expert </span>
<span>networks are typically homogenous in their architecture (e.g., small feed-forward networks) but learn </span>
<span>distinct functions over the course of training. The gating network, often a simple linear layer </span>
<span>followed by a softmax function, serves as a dynamic router. For a given input vector x, the gating network produces a </span>
<span>normalized distribution of weights over the N experts, effectively learning to predict which experts </span>
<span>are most suitable for processing that specific input.</span></p>
<p><span>The final output of the MoE layer, $y$, is not the output of a single chosen expert but </span>
<span>rather a weighted sum of the outputs from all experts. The weights for this </span>
<span>summation are precisely the probabilities generated by the gating network. The output is thus computed as:</span></p>
<p><span>$$y = \sum_{i=1}^{N} g_i(x) \, E_i(x)$$</span></p>
<p><span>where $E_i(x)$ is the output of the i-th expert for the input $x$, and $g(x)$ is the vector of gating weights produced by the gating </span>
<span>network G. The weights are typically computed via a softmax over the logits.</span></p>
<p><span>In practice, to enforce sparsity and reduce computation, a variant known as </span>
<span>the Sparse Mixture of Experts is commonly deployed. In this formulation, only the </span>
<span>experts with the highest gating weights—the </span>&ldquo;<span>top-k</span>&rdquo;<span> experts, where $k$ is a small </span>
<span>integer (e.g., 1 or 2)—are activated. The gating weights are re-normalized over </span>
<span>this small subset of selected experts. This ensures that the computational cost is independent </span>
<span>of the total number of experts, N, and dependent only on k. This sparse, conditional activation is the key to the MoE</span>&rsquo;<span>s efficiency.</span></p>

    </h1>
<p><span>Imagine you</span>&rsquo;<span>re training a very powerful neural network to recognize different classes of images, like </span>
<span>cats, dogs, and cars. In the beginning, the network struggles, but eventually, it gets </span>
<span>a perfect score on your training data.</span></p>
<p><span>You might think that if you keep training it on the same data, it would </span>
<span>either stop learning or get confused and </span>&ldquo;<span>overthink</span>&rdquo;<span> the problem. But </span>
<span>something remarkable and unexpected happens instead: the network</span>&rsquo;<span>s internal </span>
<span>organization becomes incredibly simple and tidy. This process of self-organization </span>
<span>into a perfect, simple structure is called Neural Collapse.</span></p>
<p><span>It</span>&rsquo;<span>s driven by the network</span>&rsquo;<span>s hidden preference to find the </span>
<span>most efficient and straightforward solution possible, even after it has already solved the main problem.</span>
<span>Neural Collapse can be broken down into four distinct things that happen at the same time during the final stages of training.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>All Examples of a Class Become One (Variability Collapse)</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The network learns to ignore the unique details of individual images within the same class.</span></p>
<p><span>Example: Instead of creating slightly different internal </span>&ldquo;<span>codes</span>&rdquo;<span> for a fluffy Persian cat, a sleek Siamese </span>
<span>cat, and a tabby cat, the network starts producing the exact same internal code for all of them. It effectively creates a single, perfect, </span>&ldquo;<span>ultimate cat</span>&rdquo;<span> representation and throws away all the variation.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<span>Class Codes Spread Out Perfectly (The Symmetrical Shape)</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Once the network has a single </span>&ldquo;<span>code</span>&rdquo;<span> for each class (like </span>&ldquo;<span>ultimate cat,</span>&rdquo;<span> </span>&ldquo;<span>ultimate dog,</span>&rdquo;<span> and </span>&ldquo;<span>ultimate car</span>&rdquo;<span>), it arranges these codes in the most spread-out way possible.</span></p>
<p><span>Example: If you have three classes, their codes will form the points of a </span>
<span>perfect equilateral triangle in the network</span>&rsquo;<span>s internal space. If you have four classes, they form a tetrahedron. This is the most symmetrical and separated arrangement possible, making the classes maximally distinct from one another. This perfect geometric structure is called a Simplex ETF.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<span>The Decision-Maker Aligns Perfectly (Self-Duality)</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>The final part of the network that makes the decision (the </span>&ldquo;<span>classifier</span>&rdquo;<span>) also simplifies. The classifier</span>&rsquo;<span>s internal </span>
<span>template for </span>&ldquo;<span>cat</span>&rdquo;<span> perfectly lines up with the network</span>&rsquo;<span>s </span>&ldquo;<span>ultimate cat</span>&rdquo;<span> code. The decision-maker becomes a perfect mirror of the data</span>&rsquo;<span>s new, simple structure.</span></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<span>The Whole System Becomes a Simple </span>&ldquo;<span>Nearest-Neighbor</span>&rdquo;<span> Game</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>Because of the three changes above, the network</span>&rsquo;<span>s complex decision-making process becomes incredibly simple. To classify a new image:</span></p>
<p><span>Example: The network creates a code for the new image. Then, it just checks which of its </span>&ldquo;<span>ultimate</span>&rdquo;<span> class </span>
<span>codes (the points of the triangle or tetrahedron) is the closest. If the </span>&ldquo;<span>ultimate cat</span>&rdquo;<span> code is the nearest neighbor, it classifies the image as a cat. The sophisticated deep network ends up behaving like a much simpler classifier.</span></p>
<p><span>To help people see this, researchers created animations showing the process. Imagine little blue balls (individual images) clustering together into a single </span>
<span>point for each class. These points (class means) then move to form a perfect symmetrical shape (the green target points), and the </span>
<span>decision-maker (red lines) aligns with them perfectly. This drive towards simplicity has important consequences.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The Good: The super-organized structure makes the network very good at its main job and very good at identifying things </span>
<span>that are completely different from what it was trained on. The neat, tight clusters make it easy to spot an outsider.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The Trade-Off (The Bad): This simplicity comes at a cost. By erasing all the subtle details within a </span>
<span>class, the network can hurt its ability to learn new, related things later.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><span>After reading the book The Rules of the Flock I got inspired to test some </span>
<span>ideas of the book. Basically a swarm behavior is defined when individual agents, following </span>
<span>a simple set of local rules without a central leader, produce complex and </span>
<span>intelligent collective patterns.</span></p>
<p><span>To see these rules in action, I developed the interactive Python simulation </span>
<span>detailed below. Using Matplotlib, the simulation visualizes a </span>
<span>flock of </span>&lsquo;<span>boids</span>&rsquo;<span>. You can use the sliders to change the weight of </span>
<span>each rule in real-time—crank up </span>&lsquo;<span>Cohesion</span>&rsquo;<span> to see the flock tighten, or increase </span>
&lsquo;<span>Separation</span>&rsquo;<span> to watch them spread out. You can also interact directly </span>
<span>with the swarm using your mouse, acting as a predator to </span>
<span>scatter the flock or a point of interest to draw them in. It</span>&rsquo;<span>s a fascinating look </span>
<span>at how complex, life-like motion can emerge from a few simple, local instructions.</span></p>

    </h1>
<p><span>Here are some quick notes on concepts in Mechanistic Interpretability. The subject is vast and very recent and </span>
<span>try to interpret features for neural networks, specifically transformers and LLM</span>&rsquo;<span>s.</span></p>
<p><span>This was based on my studies and mainly on this blog post </span><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/glossary"><span>Link to blog</span></a><span>. On the future when I advanced</span>
<span>my studies on this subject I will update this post.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Interpretability: The broader AI subfield focused on understanding why AI systems behave as they do and translating this into human-understandable explanations.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Feature: A property of the model</span>&rsquo;<span>s input or a part of it. Features are fundamental; the model</span>&rsquo;<span>s internal activations represent them, and computations (weights, non-linearities) transform earlier features into later ones.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Circuit: A specific part of the model that performs an understandable computation, transforming interpretable input features into interpretable output features.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Intervening on or editing an activation: The process of running the model up to a certain point, modifying a specific activation value, and then letting the model continue its computation with the changed value.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Pruning a neuron: A specific intervention where a neuron</span>&rsquo;<span>s activation is set to zero, preventing subsequent layers from using its output.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Equivariance / Neuron families: Groups of neurons or features that are distinct but operate analogously. Understanding one member of the family helps understand the others.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Neuron splitting: When a single feature represented in a smaller model gets broken down into multiple distinct features in a larger model.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Universality: The hypothesis that the same functional circuits will emerge and be discoverable across different models trained independently.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Motif: An abstract computational pattern or structure that recurs across different circuits or features in various models or contexts.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Localised/sparse model behaviour: When a model</span>&rsquo;<span>s specific behavior is determined by only a small number of its components.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Microscope AI: The idea that by reverse engineering a highly capable (potentially superhuman) AI, we could learn the novel knowledge and understanding of the world that the AI has acquired.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The curse of dimensionality: A concept highlighting the counter-intuitive properties and complexities that arise when dealing with high-dimensional spaces, like the activation spaces within neural networks.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Features as directions: A key hypothesis in MI suggesting that features within a model are represented as specific directions within the high-dimensional activation vector space.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Few-shot learning: A capability where a generative model learns to perform a new task based on just a few examples provided within its input prompt.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>In-Context Learning: The ability of a model to use information from much earlier in its input sequence (context) to make predictions about the next token.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Indirect Object Identification (IOI): A specific linguistic task used to test language models, requiring the model to identify the indirect object in sentences like </span>&ldquo;<span>When John and Mary went to the store, John gave the bag to [Mary]</span>&rdquo;<span>.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>IOI Circuit: The specific network of components identified within the GPT-2 Small model that is responsible for correctly performing the IOI task.</span></p>
</li>

<span>Basically it works as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Generate Rollouts: The LLM produces a set of text responses (rollouts) for a given prompt.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Score with the Reward Model: Each response is scored.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Compute Advantages: Using GAE, the algorithm computes how much better (or worse) each action (e.g., token choice) was compared to a baseline.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Update the Policy: A PPO objective is used with a clipped surrogate loss to ensure updates are not too drastic. Additional terms (like a KL penalty and entropy bonus) help maintain stability and encourage exploration.</span>

    </h1>
<p><span>DPO simplifies the training loop by skipping the reinforcement learning (RL) loop entirely.</span>
<span>Rather than estimating rewards and advantages, DPO directly uses human preference data (pairs of preferred vs. dispreferred responses) to adjust the model.</span>
<span>It compares the raw model outputs (logits) between a current model and a reference model (often an earlier, supervised-fine-tuned version) using a loss function similar to binary cross-entropy.</span>
<span>So basically it works as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Collect Preference Data: Gather pairs of responses where human judges indicate which response they prefer.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Evaluate with Two Models: Compute the logits for both the preferred and dispreferred responses using the current model and a reference model.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Compute Log Ratios: Determine the relative “strength” (log probabilities) of preferred versus dispreferred responses.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Optimize Directly: Use a loss function that, in effect, makes the current model more likely to generate preferred responses and less likely to generate dispreferred ones—all while staying close to the reference model.</span>
</li>

    </h1>
<p><span>GRPO is a twist on PPO that is designed to be leaner and faster—especially for complex reasoning tasks.</span>
<span>Instead of relying on a separate value function (critic) to estimate advantages, GRPO uses a group-based approach:</span>
<span>For a given prompt, a group of responses is generated. These responses are scored using the reward model.</span>
<span>So basically it works as follows:</span>
<span>1. Generate a Group of Responses: For each prompt, sample several responses.</span>
<span>2. Score the Responses: Use a reward model to assign a reward to each response.</span>
<span>3. Compute Group Relative Advantages: Calculate advantages by comparing each response’s reward to the group mean (and optionally normalizing by the standard deviation).</span>
<span>4. Update the Policy: Use a PPO-like objective function that takes these group relative advantages into account.</span></p>

<p><span>When we think about probability, there are three </span>
<span>main philosophical approaches: frequentist, Bayesian, and propensity. Each offers </span>
<span>a different lens for understanding uncertainty and probability.</span></p>
<section id="The-Scenario">

    <h2>
    <a href="#The-Scenario"><span>The Scenario</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>Imagine we</span>&rsquo;<span>re dealing with a new diagnostic test for a rare genetic condition that affects 1 in 1000 people. The test has the following characteristics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>If someone has the condition, the test will be positive 99% of the time (sensitivity)</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>If someone doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t have the condition, the test will be negative 95% of the time (specificity)</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Now, let</span>&rsquo;<span>s say Sarah gets tested and receives a positive result. What</span>&rsquo;<span>s the probability that she </span>
<span>actually has the condition? Each probability paradigm approaches this question differently.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="The-Frequentist-Approach">

    <h2>
    <a href="#The-Frequentist-Approach"><span>The Frequentist Approach</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>The frequentist views probability as the long-run frequency of events in repeated trials. They might say:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span>If we were to run this test on a very large number of people, and look only at </span>
<span>the positive test results, what proportion of those people would actually have the condition?</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>The frequentist would focus on the sampling distribution and confidence intervals. They might </span>
<span>resist making a direct probability statement about Sarah</span>&rsquo;<span>s individual case, arguing that she </span>
<span>either has the condition or doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t – there</span>&rsquo;<span>s no probability about it. Instead, they </span>
<span>would frame their analysis in terms of error rates and long-term frequencies.</span></p>
<p><span>In this case, they would calculate the false positive and true positive rates across a hypothetical population:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>In 1000 people, 1 person would have the condition</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>That 1 person would test positive 99% of the time = 0.99 true positives</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>The 999 people without the condition would test positive 5% of the time = 49.95 false positives</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Total positive tests = 50.94</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Proportion of positive tests that are true positives ≈ 1.94%</span>
</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="The-Bayesian-Approach">

    <h2>
    <a href="#The-Bayesian-Approach"><span>The Bayesian Approach</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>The Bayesian sees probability as a degree of belief that gets updated with </span>
<span>new evidence. They would start with a prior probability (the base </span>
<span>rate of 1/1000) and update it with the new </span>
<span>evidence (the positive test result) using Bayes</span>&rsquo;<span> Theorem.</span></p>
<p><span>The Bayesian would say: </span>&ldquo;<span>Before the test, we believed Sarah had a 0.1% chance </span>
<span>of having the condition. The positive test result gives us new information </span>
<span>to update this belief.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Using Bayes</span>&rsquo;<span> Theorem:</span>
<span>P(Condition|Positive) = P(Positive|Condition) × P(Condition) / P(Positive)</span>
<span>= 0.99 × 0.001 / (0.99 × 0.001 + 0.05 × 0.999)</span>
<span>≈ 0.0194 or about 1.94%</span></p>
<p><span>The Bayesian is comfortable making a direct probability statement about Sarah</span>
&lsquo;<span>s specific case, saying there</span>&rsquo;<span>s a 1.94% chance she has the condition.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="The-Propensity-Approach">

    <h2>
    <a href="#The-Propensity-Approach"><span>The Propensity Approach</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>The propensity theorist views probability as an objective </span>
<span>physical property – a tendency or disposition of a </span>
<span>system to produce certain outcomes. They might say:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span>The test result reflects the physical properties of Sarah</span>&rsquo;<span>s </span>
<span>genes and the testing mechanism. The probability emerges from </span>
<span>the actual physical setup of the situation.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>They would focus on the causal mechanisms involved: the biological </span>
<span>factors that cause the condition, the chemical reactions in the test, and how </span>
<span>these physical properties interact to produce results. They might analyze the </span>
<span>molecular basis of the test</span>&rsquo;<span>s accuracy and how it interacts with the genetic markers it</span>&rsquo;<span>s designed to detect.</span></p>
<p><span>These different approaches can lead to different practical recommendations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>A frequentist might emphasize the need for additional testing, pointing out that in a large population, most positive results are false positives.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>A Bayesian might focus on gathering more prior information about Sarah (family history, symptoms, etc.) to refine the probability estimate.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>A propensity theorist might advocate for understanding the biological mechanism better, perhaps recommending a different type of test that targets the condition</span>&rsquo;<span>s physical manifestations more directly.</span></p>

<p><span>One of the key techniques in diffusion models that has significantly improved their performance is </span>
<span>classifier-free guidance. In this post, we</span>&rsquo;<span>ll explore what classifier-free </span>
<span>guidance is, how it works, and implement it from scratch in PyTorch.</span></p>
<section id="What-is-Classifier-Free-Guidance">

    <h2>
    <a href="#What-is-Classifier-Free-Guidance"><span>What is Classifier-Free Guidance?</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>At its core, classifier-free guidance is an elegant technique that allows us to </span>
<span>control the generation process of diffusion models without requiring a </span>
<span>separate classifier. The key insight is that we can create a more powerful conditional generation </span>
<span>process by combining both conditional and unconditional generation in a clever way.</span></p>
<p><span>Think of it like having two artists working together:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>One artist (conditional model) who follows specific instructions</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>One artist (unconditional model) who creates freely without constraints</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span>By combining their perspectives with different weights, we can create results </span>
<span>that are both high-quality and well-aligned with our desired conditions.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="The-Mathematics-Behind-Classifier-Free-Guidance">

    <h2>
    <a href="#The-Mathematics-Behind-Classifier-Free-Guidance"><span>The Mathematics Behind Classifier-Free Guidance</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>The core equation for classifier-free guidance is surprisingly simple:</span></p>

<figure class="code-block">


<pre><code><span class="line">ε̃ = (1 + w) * εθ(zt, c) - w * εθ(zt, ∅)</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>Where:</span>
<span>- ε̃ is the guided noise prediction</span>
<span>- w is the guidance weight</span>
<span>- εθ(zt, c) is the conditional model prediction</span>
<span>- εθ(zt, ∅) is the unconditional model prediction</span></p>
<p><span>The beauty of this approach is that it doesn</span>&rsquo;<span>t require training </span>
<span>two separate models. Instead, we train a single model that can </span>
<span>handle both conditional and unconditional generation.</span></p>

<section id="Summary-of-Findings-from-UTSD-Paper">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Summary-of-Findings-from-UTSD-Paper"><span>Summary of Findings from UTSD Paper</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>The authors of the paper propose a novel architecture, UTSD, for time </span>
<span>series analysis. The researchers note the prevalence of time series </span>
<span>data in a variety of real world applications. They also point out that </span>
<span>data across different domains often have different statistical properties. They posit that this </span>
<span>creates a challenge to the generalizability and robustness of time </span>
<span>series analysis. In order to address this, the authors propose a unified time </span>
<span>series diffusion model. The paper explains that the UTSD model </span>
<span>uses a diffusion denoising process, in contrast to autoregressive models, to model </span>
<span>the mixture distribution of cross-domain data and generate a prediction sequence for </span>
<span>the target domain. The model learns from time series data across a range of domains </span>
<span>with the goal of having strong generalization capabilities and robustness to achieve zero-shot </span>
<span>inference on unseen domains. UTSD consists of three key designs:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Condition-denoising architecture</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Reverse noise reduction process in the actual sequence space</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Conditional generation strategy based on improved classifier-free guidance</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The paper reports that UTSD outperforms existing foundation models on all data domains. It achieves an average </span>
<span>MSE reduction of 14.2%, 20.1%, and 27.6% compared to the existing Moirai, UniTime, and GPT4TS, respectively. The paper also </span>
<span>reports that UTSD, when trained from scratch, achieves comparable performance to domain-specific models. In the paper, the authors </span>
<span>contend that UTSD shows stable and reliable time series generation which indicates the </span>
<span>model</span>&rsquo;<span>s potential as a foundational model for time series analysis.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="Explanation-of-the-Paper">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Explanation-of-the-Paper"><span>Explanation of the Paper</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>The paper presents a detailed explanation of the UTSD model architecture and its three key design elements. These designs aim </span>
<span>to address the challenges of modeling probability distributions across multiple time series domains and generating accurate </span>
<span>long-term forecasts.</span></p>

<section id="1-Condition-Denoising-Architecture">

    <h3>
    <a href="#1-Condition-Denoising-Architecture"><span>1. Condition-Denoising Architecture</span> </a>
    </h3>
<p><span>This architecture includes a Condition Net and a Denoising Net. The Condition Net learns multi-scale </span>
<span>representations of temporal fluctuation patterns from different time series domains. These representations </span>
<span>are then used as conditional variables to guide the Denoising Net in generating the prediction sequence. The paper argues </span>
<span>that capturing multi-scale representations is crucial because time series from various domains often exhibit different latent patterns.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="2-Reverse-Noise-Reduction-in-Actual-Sequence-Space">

    <h3>
    <a href="#2-Reverse-Noise-Reduction-in-Actual-Sequence-Space"><span>2. Reverse Noise Reduction in Actual Sequence Space</span> </a>
    </h3>
<p><span>UTSD performs the reverse noise reduction process directly in the actual sequence space, unlike traditional </span>
<span>diffusion models that operate in a latent space. This design choice is justified by the fact that iterative </span>
<span>denoising in the latent space can lead to error accumulation, which is amplified when aligning </span>
<span>the latent space back to the actual sequence space.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="3-Improved-Classifier-Free-Guidance">

    <h3>
    <a href="#3-Improved-Classifier-Free-Guidance"><span>3. Improved Classifier-Free Guidance</span> </a>
    </h3>
<p><span>The UTSD model uses an improved classifier-free guidance strategy to ensure strong generalization ability. This strategy leverages the multi-scale </span>
<span>representation captured by the Condition Net as a conditional variable to guide the reconstruction of the forecast from Gaussian noise.</span></p>
</section>
<section id="Additional-Architectural-Components">

    <h3>
    <a href="#Additional-Architectural-Components"><span>Additional Architectural Components</span> </a>
    </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><strong><span>Transfer-Adapter Module:</span></strong></strong><span> This module allows for efficient fine-tuning of the pre-trained UTSD model on specific downstream tasks. It transforms </span>
<span>the fluctuation patterns learned during pre-training into the latent space of the target domain, enabling the generation of domain-specific time series samples.</span>
</li>
<li>
<strong><strong><span>Blocks Implementation:</span></strong></strong><span> The Condition Net and Denoising Net are built using ResNet1D and Transformer1D modules. The ResNet1D modules handle </span>
<span>the embedding of diffusion timesteps and latent representations, while the Transformer1D modules capture dependencies within the observation sequence and leverage historical fluctuation patterns as context for denoising.</span>
