# Implementing the Kalman Filter in Python

![](/assets/kalman1.jpg)

Hello. I'm trying to experiment with some recent articles that tries to 
connect transformers and kalman filter. I remember that I saw in my undergrad
this concept on the control lecture but to be honest I didn't quite understand
the concept at the time. To help my understanding i tried to implement
using only some basic python libraries the Kalman Filter in python.

Before the notebook with the implementation here is a quick summary of what is 
this filter provided by GPT ( =P ):


A Kalman filter is a powerful algorithm used for making estimates or predictions in systems 
that are subject to various uncertainties. It's widely used in fields like robotics, aerospace,
finance, and even weather forecasting. Here's a simplified explanation suitable for a blog post:

* Understanding the Kalman Filter: A Simple Guide
Imagine you're trying to predict the position of a moving car using a GPS system. The GPS provides 
you with location data, but this data isn't perfect—it has some level of inaccuracy or 'noise'. How do you 
make the best possible estimate of the car's true position?

* Enter the Kalman filter. Developed by Rudolf E. Kalman in the 1960s, this algorithm is a set of mathematical equations 
that provides an efficient computational (recursive) solution to the problem of estimating the state of a process—in our case, the position and speed of the car.

* How Does It Work?
The Kalman filter works in two fundamental
steps: Prediction and Update.

* Prediction: This step involves predicting the current state 
of the process (like the position and velocity of the car) based on the
previous state. It's like saying, "Given where the car was and 
how fast it was moving, here's where I think it is now."

* Update: In this step, the Kalman filter takes new measurements (e.g., from the GPS) and
refines the prediction. It essentially asks, "Now that I have new data, how should I
adjust my prediction to be more accurate?"

The beauty of the Kalman filter lies in its ability to deal with uncertainty. It's designed to weigh both the
predicted state and the new measurements, considering the uncertainties in
both. If the measurements are very accurate, it gives them more weight. If the predictions are believed to be more reliable, it leans more on them.

* Real-World Applications
While the GPS example is straightforward, the Kalman filter is used in much more complex
situations. It's vital in the operation of satellites and spacecraft, where precise navigation is crucial. In the financial world, it
helps in predicting market trends and in robotics, it's used for navigation and tracking movements.
