One of the most interesting question to be made is about the nature of consciousness.
During a long time the question of consciousness was considered as a philosophical question
but during the last decades this question has been approached by the science with the
emergence of the Integrated Information Theory (IIT) by Giulio Tononi.
This paradigm, proposes a radical reconceptualization of consciousness, framing 
it as an intrinsic property of physical systems, quantifiable through information integration.

At its core, IIT posits that consciousness arises from the intricate interplay of information 
within a system. Tononi's theory begins with five axiomatic properties of phenomenal 
experience: intrinsic existence, composition, information, integration, and exclusion. These axioms 
serve as the bedrock upon which the mathematical edifice of IIT is constructed.

The theory introduces a novel metric, denoted by the Greek letter Φ (phi), which quantifies the degree of integ
rated information within a system. This measure, Φ, becomes the crux of IIT's framework, hypothesizing a 
direct correlation between its magnitude and the intensity of conscious experience.

Central to IIT is the concept of a system's cause-effect structure - a complex network of causal relationships 
that defines the system's internal dynamics. This structure, IIT argues, gives rise to the qualitative aspects 
of consciousness, or qualia, through the specific patterns of information integration it engenders.

As the theory unfolds, it presents a nuanced view of consciousness as a spectrum rather than a binary state. This perspective 
implies that consciousness, to varying degrees, may be a fundamental feature of reality, potentially extending beyond 
biological systems to any entity capable of integrating information in specific ways.

One big problem with this theory is the lack of empirical validation. Nevertheless, I believe that 
an initial functional theory of consciousness is a good starting point to build models more closely
related to AGI. As the perceptron is a model that simplifies a lot the human brain, but is a good starting point
and you can build marvelous things with it, I think that the same way of thinking can be applied to consciousness
theories. We could start with this simple functional theory and then build more complex ones, but with these simpler
theories we may already be capable to build marvelous things.
