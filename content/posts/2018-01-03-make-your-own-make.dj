# Make your own make

## Introduction

[Cargo]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/

One of my favorite features of [Cargo][Cargo] is that it is **not** a general
purpose build tool. This allows Cargo to really excel at the task of building
Rust code, without usual Turing tarpit of build configuration files. I have yet
to see a complicated Cargo.toml file!

However, once a software project grows, it's almost inevitable that it will
require some tasks *besides* building Rust code. For example, you might need to
integrate several languages together, or to setup some elaborate testing for
non-code aspects of your project, like checking the licenses, or to establish an
elaborate release procedure.

For such use-cases, a general purpose task automation solution is needed. In
this blog post I want to describe one possible approach, which leans heavily on
Cargo's built-in functionality.

## Existing Solutions

The simplest way to automate something is to write a shell script. However there
are few experts in the arcane art of shell scripting, and shell scripts are
inherently platform dependent.

The same goes for make, with its many annoyingly similar flavors.

[cargo-make]: https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make

Two tools which significantly improve on the ease of use and ergonomics are
[just][] and [cargo make][cargo-make]. Alas, they still mostly rely on the
shell to actually execute the tasks.


## Reinventing the Wheel

Obligatory [XKCD 927](https://xkcd.com/927/):

An obvious idea is to use Rust for task automation. Originally, I have proposed
creating a special Cargo subcommand to execute build tasks, implemented as Rust
programs, in [this
thread](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/idea-for-a-crate-tool-cargo-task/15300/).
However, since then I realized that there are built-in tools in Cargo which
allow one to get a pretty ergonomic solution. Namely, the combination of
workspaces, aliases and ability to define binaries seems to do the trick.


## Elements of the Solution

If you just want a working example, see [this
commit](https://github.com/matklad/libsyntax2/commit/bb381a7ff7a21cad98d80005a81f2586684f80a0).

A typical Rust project looks like this

```
frobnicator/
  Cargo.toml
  src/
    lib.rs
```

Suppose that we want to add a couple of tasks, like generating some code from
some specification in the [RON](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) format, or
grepping the source code for `TODO` marks.

First, create a special `tools` package:

```
frobnicator/
  Cargo.toml
  src/
    lib.rs
  tools/
    Cargo.toml
    src/bin/
      gen.rs
      todo.rs
```


The `tools/Cargo.toml` might look like this:

```toml
# file: frobnicator/tools/Cargo.toml

[package]
name = "tools"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = []
# We never publish our tasks
publish = false

[dependencies]
# These dependencies are isolated from the main crate.
serde = "1.0.26"
serde_derive = "1.0.26"
file = "1.1.1"
ron = "0.1.5"
```

Then, we add a
[`[workspace]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-workspace-section)
to the parent package:

```toml
# file: frobnicator/Cargo.toml

[workspace]
members = ["tools"]
```

We need this section because `tools` is not a dependency of `frobnicator`, so it
won't be picked up automatically.

Then, we write code to accomplish the tasks in `tools/src/bin/gen.rs` and
`tools/src/bin/todo.rs`.

Finally, we add `frobnicator/.cargo/config` with the following contents:

```toml
# file: frobnicator/.cargo/config

[alias]
gen  = "run --package tools --bin gen"
todo = "run --package tools --bin todo"
```

Voil√†! Now, running `cargo gen` or `cargo todo` will execute the tasks!
