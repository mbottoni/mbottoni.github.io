# Scarf: Self Supervised Learning for Tabular Data

![](/assets/frontier/scarf.png)

Machine learning often struggles with the scarcity of labeled data. While unlabeled datasets 
are abundant, obtaining high-quality labeled data remains expensive and time-consuming. SCARF 
emerges as a breakthrough methodology that transforms how we extract meaningful 
representations from raw, untagged information.

## Innovation

SCARF introduces a novel approach to generating data views by strategically corrupting 
input features. Unlike domain-specific augmentation techniques, this method works universally across datasets:

- Randomly select a subset of features
- Replace selected features with samples from their empirical marginal distributions
- Leverage contrastive learning to maximize representation quality

## Technical Mechanism

The approach employs:

- An encoder network (f)
- A pre-training head network (g)
- InfoNCE contrastive loss function

The core objective is generating representations that maintain semantic integrity 
while being robust to feature perturbations.

Tested across 72 real-world classification datasets, SCARF demonstrated significant improvements:

- Enhanced classification accuracy
- Improved performance under label noise
- Effective semi-supervised learning capabilities
- Domain-agnostic representation learning
- Minimal sensitivity to feature scaling
- Hyperparameter stability
- Compatibility with existing machine learning techniques

SCARF represents a pivotal advancement in self-supervised learning, offering a flexible, powerful 
approach to extracting meaningful representations with minimal labeled data.
